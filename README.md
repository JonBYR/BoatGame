# Build

This project also contains a build which runs in Windows. The build is found in the releases section of the repo, where a zip file can be downloaded that contains the executable. The player can use WASD or the arrow keys to move the boat. Pressing W will ensure that the camera shows the player what is in front of them whilst
pressing S switches the camera so that the player can see behind them when reversing. Acceleration and deceleration occurs when pressing W/S/Up Arrow/Down Arrow, whilst turning is implemented by pressing A/D/Left Arrow/Right Arrow whilst accelerating or decelerating. The scene can be reset if the boat has capsized by 
pressing R and the application can be exited by pressing Q. On completion of the game a UI panel will display with a button to reset the game, this button can be pressed using the mouse.
